# Project Title

List Pagination and Filtering

## Getting Started

The JavaScript code within this project allows for easy navigation amongst a list of students.  

At the top of the page you will notice a search feature.  Upon typing a name you will start to see the results narrow down depending upon what is typed into the search box.  If you enter a name that does not exist you will receive a 'Your search returned zero results' message.

At the bottom you will notice that there are links, (pagination).  By clicking on one of these numbers you will see a new list of students appear.
